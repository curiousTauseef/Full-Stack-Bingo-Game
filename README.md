## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB--
In this project the user gets a bingo board that they can use to play bingo with. When the use hears their number they click on the check and the spot turns green. If the user gets bingo they click the bingo button and follow the instructions. 
For the Game master they need log in to get the app to acces the randomizer. They click the get number button and gets a number to call. The Game master can also log the players and keep track of winners. 

## Optimizations
If there was more time I would put alert to the Admin when the player wins.  

## Lessons Learned:
I learned more about creating full stack apss.
